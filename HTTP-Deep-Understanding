# HTTP Deep Understanding

## Objective
To understand HTTP method behavior, idempotency, and status code classification through direct request execution and observation.

---

## Environment
Tool: Postman  
Public APIs used:
- https://httpbin.org
- https://reqres.in (limited due to access restriction)

---

## 1. HTTP Methods Analysis

### GET

Example:
GET https://httpbin.org/get?name=ais&role=qa

Observation:
- Status code: 200 OK
- Query parameters were returned under the `args` field.
- No request body required.
- Repeated execution produced identical responses.

Conclusion:
GET is idempotent.  
It retrieves data without modifying server state.

---

### POST

Example:
POST https://httpbin.org/post

Body:
{
  "name": "ais",
  "role": "qa"
}

Observation:
- Status code: 200 OK (httpbin echoes request)
- Request payload returned under `json` field.
- Repeated requests are treated as separate executions.

Conclusion:
POST is non-idempotent.  
Each execution represents a new action.

---

### PUT

Example:
PUT https://httpbin.org/put

Body:
{
  "name": "ais"
}

Observation:
- Status code: 200 OK
- Payload returned correctly.
- Repeated execution with same body resulted in identical output.

Conclusion:
PUT is idempotent.  
Sending the same request multiple times results in the same final state.

---

### DELETE

Example:
DELETE https://httpbin.org/delete

Observation:
- Status code: 200 OK
- No persistent data change (due to mock API behavior).
- Conceptually idempotent.

Conclusion:
DELETE is idempotent because repeated deletion results in the same final state (resource remains absent).

---

## 2. Status Code Analysis

### 2xx — Success
- 200 OK → Successful request.
- 201 Created → Resource successfully created.

Meaning:
Server successfully processed the request.

---

### 4xx — Client Error
- 400 Bad Request → Invalid input or malformed request.
- 404 Not Found → Resource does not exist.

Meaning:
The client sent an invalid or incorrect request.

---

### 5xx — Server Error
- 500 Internal Server Error → Unhandled exception or server failure.

Meaning:
Server failed to process a valid request.

---

## 3. Idempotency and Risk Perspective

Idempotent methods (GET, PUT, DELETE):
- Safe for retries.
- Do not multiply effects when repeated.

Non-idempotent methods (POST):
- Can create duplicate transactions.
- Risky in payment or order systems if not properly handled.

QA Relevance:
Understanding idempotency is critical when testing financial transactions, order creation, or any operation where repeated requests could cause data inconsistency.

---

## Key Takeaways

- HTTP method selection directly impacts system behavior.
- Status codes are not decorative; they indicate system correctness.
- Idempotency has real production impact, especially in transactional systems.
- Backend validation must be tested independently from UI.
